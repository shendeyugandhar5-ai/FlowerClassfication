 I performed exploratory data analysis, visualized feature relationships, trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models, compared their accuracy, evaluated results using a confusion matrix, and created a CLI script to predict flower species. This task strengthened my understanding of supervised learning and model evaluation techniques.
